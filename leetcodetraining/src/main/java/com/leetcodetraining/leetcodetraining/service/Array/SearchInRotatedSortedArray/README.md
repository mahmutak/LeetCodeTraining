## Question
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
```bash
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:
```bash
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```
## Solution

Use binary search by checking start of the array less than end of the array and finding the target between.

## Usage

```bash
Swagger: POST /searchinrotatedsortedarray
```
