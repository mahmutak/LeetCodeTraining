## Question
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
```bash
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

Constraints:
```bash
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```
## Solution
